Benjamin Freyâ€™s research investigates model systems for COPD through single-cell transcriptomic profiling as part of the RESPIRE-EXCEL MSCA doctoral network (respire-excel.eu). His work focuses on the development and benchmarking of machine learning approaches for latent representation learning, data integration, and perturbation modeling to study COPD model systems with an emphasis on clinical translatability. In addition, he contributes to projects on sample-level representation learning from single-cell data to enable cross-cohort and patient-level comparative analyses. He has a background in bioinformatics, mathematics, and molecular biotechnology, as well as experience as a machine learning researcher and data analyst.
