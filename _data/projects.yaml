  description: SPACETIME is an EU consortium studying how spatial cellular organization changes with disease severity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We are collaborating with biologists, clinicians, biotechnologists, and other computational biologists or machine learning scientists to build a spatial multiomic map of NSCLC across species and disease stages with the goal of building better diagnostics, expanding our understanding of disease mechanisms, and developing treatment options to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients.

  link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02327-2
  description: The integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) represents the first large-scale, integrated single-cell reference atlas of the human lung. It consists of over 2 million cells from the respiratory tract of 486 individuals and includes 49 different datasets. The HLCA is widely used in the community, with over 2,000 downloads of the model alone.
