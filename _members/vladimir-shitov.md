Vladimir Shitov is interested in patient-level analysis of single-cell data. He develops a benchmark of the existing methods, builds [patpy](https://github.com/lueckenlab/patpy/tree/main) – a sample-level single-cell data analysis framework, and analyzes datasets with a focus on pulmonary diseases, such as COPD. Other contributions include development of Open Pipelines for single-cell data processing, development of ehrapy – a Python framework for exploratory electronic health record data analysis, and Open Problems competition results analysis to distill best practices for cross-modality prediction.
