I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Computational Biology](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab), Helmholtz Munich. My research focuses on developing representation learning approaches, image-based profiling and data analysis of spatial data. I am also a board member of image-based profiling society [CytoData](https://www.cytodata.org/). I completed my PhD and was a postdoc at [Peter Horvath's lab](http://group.szbk.u-szeged.hu/sysbiol/horvath-peter-lab-index.html) on image segmentation and phenotypic profiling in collaboration with [Juan Caicedo's lab](https://morgridge.org/research/labs/caicedo/), which is still ongoing.
