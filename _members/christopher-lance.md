Together with labs of the HCA gut bionetwork, Christopher Lance is building the gut cell atlas for the HCA consortium. Furthermore, he is analysing a large scale single cell data set of very early onset IBD patients whereby integrating genomics, scRNA and proteomics data sets to understand patient heterogeneity and understand genetically driven mechanisms causing intestinal inflammation. As part of the Open problems initiative, Christopher Lance has been contributing to tasks related to multimodal single-cell data such as integrating and predicting modalities.
