Together with the JÃ¼rgen Ruland Lab at the TUM clinic, Daniel Strobl is looking into T-Cell lymphoma development in mouse models on a single cell level. Furthermore, he is interested in developing approaches to compare single-cell disease datasets between mouse models and human samples. Also, Daniel is working on single-cell atlassing and has been involved in benchmarking single-cell integration methods and the HLCA and is currently building a HCA Pancreas atlas.
