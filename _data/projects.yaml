  description: SPACETIME is an EU consortium studying how spatial cellular organization changes with disease severity in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We are collaborating with biologists, clinicians, biotechnologists, and other computational biologists or machine learning scientists to build a spatial multiomic map of NSCLC across species and disease stages with the goal of building better diagnostics, expanding our understanding of disease mechanisms, and developing treatment options to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients.
